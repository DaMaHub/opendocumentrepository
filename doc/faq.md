# FAQ

#### Q: I tried to install the project but it does not work anymore with the most up-to-date version of IPFS or py-ipfs-api. Why don't you fix the required version numbers?
A: IPFS is still a moving target and we noticed that old-version nodes tend to get moved out of the network quickly. So fixing a version will not help.
