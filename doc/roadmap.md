# Roadmap for Open Document Repository

In this document we present the state and the future plans for this project.

# Status

We started Open Document Repository to show what is possible right now if you combine two radical new technologies: Blockchain and IPFS. 

# Roadmap

## Version 1

This is what we have right now.

* Technology demonstration
* uses DogeCoin blockchain
* no authentication of users
* Versions based on documents, so meta-data changes do not create new versions

## Version 2

* User authentication
* NameCoin support
* Metadata is versioned as well
* Dublin Core metadata
* IPFS upload via ipfs hash

## Version 3
* JS Version of IPFS for document upload
* Plugin-System for metadata support
